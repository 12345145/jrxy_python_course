## Python in Finance

Applying Python in solving practical issues in finance.  Materials in this repo are designed for students taking my course 《Python在金融中的应用》. 

If you have any question, I would be approachable by email ni.he@qq.com. 

### Software 

+ Python 3.* 

+ [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (Spyder)    You can download the latest official version from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/), and if you experienced a bad connection, a mirror site maintained by Tsinghua is available [here](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/archive/).  Tutorial in Chinese is available [here](https://www.jianshu.com/p/62f155eb6ac5). 

  *You could surely use other IDE for programming*

### Data source
+ Tushare  (http://www.tushare.org or https://tushare.pro/)
+ IEX Finance  (https://pypi.org/project/iexfinance/)

    "### The Sharpe Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sharpe ratio is perhaps the most widely used tool for evaluating the risk-adjusted rate of return on investment portfolios. It does so by comparing the actual or expected return on an investment to the return on a risk-free investment, such as bond. It compares the two rates of return, factoring in the standard deviation for the investment portfolio, to provide an investor with an idea of how much additional gain he or she is receiving (if any) in return for taking on the additional risk associated with investing in equities."

    "#### Information Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The information ratio in finance is one of the most important ratios in **active management**. The appraisal ratio measures the level of outperformance of an active strategy over the benchmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$IR = \\frac{E(r_s-r_b)}{std(r_s-r_b)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_s$ is the strategy return and $r_b$ is the benchmark return, and the $std(r_s-r_b)$ could be interpreted as the **tracking error**. The difference between both is the **active return**. As such, the IR is equal to the expected active return divided by the tracking error. In other words, the ratio measures the active return of the investor's strategy divided by the amount of risk that he takes relative the the benchmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The information ratio is a measurement of portfolio returns above the returns of a benchmark. \n",
    "2. The information ratio is used to evaluate the skill of a portfolio manager at generating returns in excess of a given benchmark.\n",
    "3. A higher (0.3 - 0.4 would be fairly good) IR result implies a better portfolio manager who's achieving a higher return in excess of the benchmark, given the risk taken\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The information ratio identifies how much a fund has exceeded a benchmark. Higher information ratios indicate a desired level of consistency, whereas low information ratios indicate the opposite. Many investors use the information ratio when selecting exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds based on their preferred risk profiles. Of course, past performance is not an indicator of future results, but the IR is used to determine whether a portfolio is exceeding a benchmark index fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation\n",
    "Comparing multiple funds against a benchmark is difficult to interpret because the funds might have different securities, asset allocations for each sector and entry points in their investments. As with any single financial ratio, it's best to look at additional types of ratios and other financial metrics to make a more comprehensive and informed investment decision."

    "### Sortino Ratio\n",
    "The Sortino ratio is a variation of the Sharpe ratio that differentiates **harmful volatility** from total overall volatility by using the asset's standard deviation of negative portfolio returns—downside deviation—instead of the total standard deviation of portfolio returns. The Sortino ratio takes an asset or portfolio's return and subtracts the risk-free rate, and then divides that amount by the asset's downside deviation. The ratio was named after Frank A. Sortino.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Key points\n",
    "- The Sortino ratio differs from the Sharpe ratio in that it only considers the standard deviation of the downside risk, rather than that of the entire (upside + downside) risk.\n",
    "- Because the Sortino ratio focuses only on the negative deviation of a portfolio's returns from the mean, it is thought to give a better view of a portfolio's risk-adjusted performance since positive volatility is a benefit.\n",

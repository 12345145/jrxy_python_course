## About Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning is a set of algorithms that learn to discover trends and patterns in data to gain insights. These algorithms then become self-sufficient to make decisions on the data.

Machine learning algorithms are now utilised in nearly all sectors — from healthcare to financial organisations to anti-fraud companies to shopping websites.


#### How is it different from traditional programming?

Machine learning is about getting machines to learn data and then make decisions on similar data. Machine learning is about using *predictive algorithms* to forecast the behaviours of data so that calculated decisions can be taken.

>Machine learning algorithms are built on statistical features.

#### Why Is Machine Learning So Popular

You might have heard the words artificial intelligence/deep learning/machine learning/big data/data scientist in the near past and possibly more recently.

Machine learning’s growing popularity is primarily due to an increase in data availability and advancements in technology.


#### What Is Involved In Building A Machine Learning Application?

A range of skills is required to build machine learning applications. We need subject matter experts who understand data and can interpret data in an efficient manner. These experts are occasionally known as data scientists or domain experts. Often domain experts are teamed up with technical experts who help build intelligent algorithms that predict future and make calculated decisions.

**Data Scientists = Domain Experts + Programmers**

>The machine learning model is a set of rules or instructions or software procedures implemented by a combination of a domain and technical experts. These experts are also known as Data Scientists.

Domain experts help technical experts understand the data so that efficient and accurate algorithms can be built and models can be trained. Technical experts help domain experts by programming efficient routines that break and structure large amounts of data in a fast manner.

#### Machine learning process

At a high level, the process is:

1. Gather and clean data (sample) to represent large data (population) — this step can at times take the longest time.
2. Learn and understand data to figure out trends and patterns
3. Build a model that understands the data and makes decisions on data
4. Feed the model 70%-80% of sample data. This set of data is known as **Training Data**.
5. Validate the model with the rest of the data. This set of data is known as **Test Data**.
6. Based on results, repeat the steps if required.

>Machine learning applications need technical experts who can implement computationally intensive and intelligent algorithms efficiently and domain experts who can understand data, classify it and figure out trends and patterns.

#### Machine Learning Algorithm Variants

Machine learning algorithms variations are based on how the algorithms learn. Working out the rules and programming them is also a hard task. This is where your technical expertise will help. Machine learning algorithms can be classified into three categories:

1. Supervised, 2. Unsupervised and 3. Reinforcement Learning. 


>Choosing the right machine learning algorithm is based on **trial-and-error**. Although one can try all possible algorithms to find the right algorithm but it can save us time and cost if we understand the differences between algorithms.

### Supervised algorithm 

This family of algorithms can be used to find relationships between data. The algorithm is given a set of inputs (known as labelled or tagged data) and then instructed what the expected output is. In supervised algorithms, concepts are taught, data is familiarised to an extent that decisions can be made on new data.

>Supervised learning is like performing a task, which you were taught before and you have a fairly good idea about the expected result for the given set of inputs.

The supervised algorithm works out rules that can give expected output for the given inputs. This decision-making ability then enables the algorithm to forecast new inputs and make decisions. When new data is encountered, existing data and rules are utilised to understand and to make decisions on the data.

Supervised algorithms are expected to forecast on data.

*Think Of Supervised As Guided Learning By Human.*

**Examples: random forests, decision trees etc.**

### Unsupervised algorithm

This family of algorithms can be used to categorise data, find abnormal data items or for anomaly detection e.g. finding fraud transactions from a large set of transactions.

Unsupervised learning algorithms are purposed to model structures, data distributions and workout the results themselves.

Inputs are given without expected outputs.

>Unsupervised learning is like performing a task that you have not experienced before and you start the experience by gathering as much information as possible. Imagine learning a language without knowing the basics of the language.

When new data is encountered, data is classified first and then categorized into clusters or groups. Finally, decisions are made on the new data.

*Think Of Unsupervised Algorithms As Self-Taught Algorithms.*

Classification information is given and then large data is fed into the algorithm so that it can classify the data into appropriate groups and then make decisions.

Unsupervised learning can be used to solve problems that are very complex in nature as the algorithms can learn to solve the problem themselves.

**Examples: K means, clustering etc.**

### Reinforcement algorithm

This family of algorithms learn from the environment through interactions, mainly for robots and in games.

Inspired by behaviour psychology, the algorithms are mainly used in Game theory and simulation optimisation methods. Reinforcement learning concept revolves around agents taking actions based on the reward of their previous actions.

**Example: Bandit, Q-learning, SARSA**

### Neural network algorithm 

It can be used as supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. This is a brief introduction of forward feedback neural network.
